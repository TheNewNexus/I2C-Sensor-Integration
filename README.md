## I²C Sensor Integration

This embedded system uses I²C to interface both an MPU6050 gyroscope/accelerometer and a TCS34725 color sensor. The TCS34725 detects colors from a piece of paper mounted on a servo, and the detected color is mirrored on an RGB LED. The servo's position is controlled via PWM, allowing dynamic adjustment to scan or present different colored areas.

## Key Components and Communication

- **MPU6050 (Gyroscope/Accelerometer)**
  - Communicates via I²C (default address: 0x68 or 0x69)[5][7].
  - Provides orientation/acceleration data, which can be used for motion feedback or stabilization[1][5][7].

- **TCS34725 (Color Sensor)**
  - Communicates via I²C (address: 0x29)[6][8].
  - Measures RGB and clear light values with high sensitivity and outputs digital color data over I²C[6][8].
  - Ideal for detecting color on surfaces, such as paper presented by a servo.

- **Servo Motor**
  - Controlled via PWM from the microcontroller.
  - Adjusts the position of the paper so different colors can be detected by the TCS34725.

- **RGB LED**
  - Driven by GPIO/PWM.
  - Color output is set to match the RGB values detected by the TCS34725.

## System Workflow

1. **Servo Positioning:**  
   The microcontroller sets the servo position using PWM to present a specific colored area to the TCS34725.

2. **Color Detection:**  
   The TCS34725 reads the color data from the paper and communicates the RGB values to the microcontroller over I²C[6][8].

3. **Color Mirroring:**  
   The microcontroller processes the RGB data and sets the RGB LED outputs to match the detected color.

4. **Gyro Feedback (Optional):**  
   The MPU6050 provides orientation data, which can be used for additional features such as compensating for movement or logging the servo's orientation[5][7].

## Example I²C Communication (Pseudocode)

```c
// Initialize I2C, Servo, and RGB LED
I2C_Init();
Servo_Init();
RGB_LED_Init();
TCS34725_Init();
MPU6050_Init();

while (1) {
    // Move servo to desired position
    Servo_SetPosition(angle);

    // Read color from TCS34725
    TCS34725_ReadRGB(&r, &g, &b);

    // Set RGB LED to detected color
    RGB_LED_SetColor(r, g, b);

    // (Optional) Read orientation from MPU6050
    MPU6050_ReadGyro(&gx, &gy, &gz);

    // ... additional logic ...
}
```

## Notes

- Both sensors use I²C, so ensure unique addresses and proper bus wiring (SDA/SCL lines)[5][6][8].
- The TCS34725 provides 16-bit RGB values and is sensitive to ambient lighting; consider shielding or calibrating as needed[6][8].
- The servo should be powered appropriately to avoid noise on the I²C bus.

## Applications

- Educational robotics and color sorting
- Automated color recognition and feedback systems
- Interactive art installations

This architecture enables real-time color detection and mirroring, with potential for expansion using gyroscope feedback for more advanced motion-aware applications.
